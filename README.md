Deep Learning Object Detection for Autonomous Robots
A complete YOLOv8 + PyBullet integration for autonomous robot navigation

 Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
 1.Detect objects in real-time using YOLOv8
 2.Simulate robots with cameras in PyBullet
 3.Navigate autonomously using computer vision
 4.Train custom models for specific objects
 5.Deploy models in simulated environments

 What You'll Learn
Real-time object detection with state-of-the-art AI
3D physics-based robot simulation
Vision-based autonomous navigation
Custom model training and deployment
Integration of computer vision and robotics

The system offers four core capabilities:
(1) Object Detection powered by YOLOv8 to identify over 80 object types in real-time; 
(2) Robot Simulation using PyBullet to create a realistic 3D physics-based environment; 
(3) Autonomous Navigation driven by a custom algorithm for vision-guided movement and decision-making; and
(4) Custom Training leveraging transfer learning to enable detection of user-defined objects.

Quick Summary
This project combines cutting-edge AI (YOLOv8) with realistic robot simulation (PyBullet) to create an autonomous robot that:

Sees objects using a camera
Recognizes them using deep learning
Navigates toward them autonomously
